Real time Ember notification client
===================================

This POC demonstrates an Html5-Ember client for real-time enterprise class applications. The client uses Server Side Events (server side push) for broadcasting changes and REST calls for interacting with the server side.

Real time data updates and REST responses are published onto an event bus for consumption by the application.
